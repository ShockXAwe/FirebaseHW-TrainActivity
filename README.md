# FirebaseHW-TrainActivity

In this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

I used bootstrap to create the HTML. It takes in the time you put in a 12hr format and converts it in the backend to 24hrs.
